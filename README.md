ALPHA! BROKEN AND POSSIBLY USELESS! USE AT OWN RISK!
A way for Europeans to scrap public available information from FT.com about their Mutual Funds and get that information into their portfolio-performance.info installation. 

P.S I am just a hobby programmer so I am sure the code is super ugly and not up to best practicies whatsoever but it does hoewever work! (somewhat haha)

portfolio performance insists on only reading HTML from webserver so you will need to start a localhost server and just point localhost to the path of where this script will be saving the files generated with latest Mutual Fund Prices. 


For now line 17 and  38 needs to be manually changed to where you want the files to be saved and where the full list of ISIN numbers are stored.
